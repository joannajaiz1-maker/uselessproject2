DESCRIPTION :

Don't Click.com is a chaotic and playful web experiment that turns a normal form into a confusing adventure. It looks simple—but it's not what it seems!

The name field plays tricks and replaces your input with random letters (until it gives up).

The year of birth options are scrambled and scroll sideways forever.

The submit button might dodge your mouse or appear only after a wait.

Your bio input clears itself if you're inactive—because why not?

After all that, if you manage to submit, you’re rewarded with... a funny image. 🎉

 This site was built for a useless project hackathon, where the goal was to have fun—not function.

PROBLEM :

We’re solving a problem that nobody asked about:

“What if filling out a simple form was a total nightmare?”

Because online forms are:

Too easy 

Too predictable 

Not nearly chaotic enough 

RandomForm.com solves this by:

Making your name unrecognizable 

Offering birth years in no logical order 

Deleting your bio when you stop typing for a moment 

Turning the submit button into a moving target 🕹

It’s the form experience you never needed, never wanted, and definitely won’t forget.

SOLUTION:

🔀 Unstable identity fields: We randomize your name to ensure you question everything.

🌀 Chronologically chaotic birth year selection: Say goodbye to predictable dropdowns.

⏳ Auto-erasing bios: Write something meaningful? Too late. It's gone.

🕹️ A slippery submit button: We teach patience through frustration.

🖼️ A pointless reward: If you survive the form, you get... an image. Why? Because chaos.

In short:
We replaced usability with unpredictability.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

HTML5:Structure of the form and content
CSS3:Styling, animations (rainbow background, movement), custom scrollbars
JavaScript:Chaos logic: name randomization, submit button evasion, bio auto-clear, delayed interaction
DOM API:Used for dynamically generating year options, event handling, form state control
setTimeout:Delays enabling the submit button and auto-clears the bio field
CSS Animations:Used for background gradients and element shake effects
Manual Routing:window.location.href used to move to a "thank you" page with an image
Google Fonts / Emoji (optional):To add quirky visual character without loading external libraries
